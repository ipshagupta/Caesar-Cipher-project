# Caesar-Cipher-project

This is a simple program of encrypting and decrypting a piece of data.

The program will run through the message and decrypt it using the Caesar Cipher concept, which was used to encode messages by shifting the places of the alphabets.
Using the same concept, this program will encrypt the message, which can include symbols and numbers as well, and will also give the option of decrypting it.

Languages used: Python
